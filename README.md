<b>DESCRIPTION</b>

------------------------------------------------

An app for advertising projects (school project)

Users have to create an accout in order to access the site. Once created they can edit their profile 
(name, nationality, description, skills, profile picture) and upload documents.

They can then create projects (title, price, deadline price, date, description), which are shown on the projects page.
A user can edit or delete their project.

Users can contact eachother via an internal messaging system. They can send them from the project site to the add creator
or through the messages page. On the messages page there are 3 tabs: new, inbox and sent. In the new tab the recipient is chosen
from a dropdown menu which contains all registrated users. Users can also send attachments. In the inbox tab users can view
the senders profile (where they can rate the user), respond to the message or delete it, same goes with the sent tab.
When a user has a new message, a notification is displayed (the number of new messages on the messages page link), which goes away
when the message is seen.

An admin can add/delte/edit skills, projects and countrys.
